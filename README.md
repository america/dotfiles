Automatic Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
コードをコピーする
git clone https://github.com/america/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
Run the Installation Script: This script will create symbolic links to your home directory.

bash
コードをコピーする
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
This script will back up any existing dotfiles in your home directory to avoid overwriting them.

Manual Installation
For more control, manually create symlinks for each configuration file:

bash
コードをコピーする
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/config/sway ~/.config/sway
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
